# Tour de France Label Analysis
The goal is to get the rider labels for a video sequence of the Tour (Stage 20, time trial will be used) to analysis the video coverage of the riders.
For this we will use
* `moviepy` for video cropping / frame iteration
* `tesseract` for ocr of individual cropped frames
